# Nordic Website

This is a custom-themed website that I developed based on what I learned from "PHP From Scratch 2024 | Beginner To Advanced". The course project, "Workopia", served as a starting point for this project. Conceptually, Nordic is a website for a small business selling ales and meads inspired by Norse mythology.

## About This Project

In Brad Traversy's course, the "Workopia" project was a practical example of how to build a PHP application from scratch. Inspired by this project, I extended and customized the codebase to create a unique themed website. Here are some key points about what I have done:

- **Base Server**: This project started as an extension of the "Workopia" project from the course.
- **Custom Features**: I have added several new features and customizations, including:
  - A new design and theme for Norse Ales.
  - Additional functionalities such as a mobile carousel, improved user interface, and dynamic content.
  - Enhanced backend logic to support the new features for shopping cart and orders.

## Credits

- **Brad Traversy**: The original "Workopia" project and course materials from the "PHP From Scratch 2024 | Beginner To Advanced" course provided the foundation for this project. You can find more about Brad Traversy's work [here](https://github.com/bradtraversy/workopia-php).
